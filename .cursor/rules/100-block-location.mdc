      When creating EDS-built blocks:

      1. Always place block files in react/src/blocks/:
         ```
         react/src/blocks/
         ├── block-name/
         │   ├── block-name.tsx
         │   └── block-name.scss
         ├── another-block/
         │   ├── another-block.tsx
         │   └── another-block.scss
         └── ...
         ```

      2. Follow the naming convention:
         - Use kebab-case for component files (e.g., block-name.tsx)
         - Use kebab-case for SCSS files (e.g., block-name.scss)
         - Component folder should match the kebab-case SCSS filename

      3. Directory structure:
         ```
         PROJECT_ROOT/
         ├── react/
         │   └── src/
         │       └── blocks/
         │           ├── block-name/
         │           │   ├── block-name.tsx
         │           │   └── block-name.scss
         │           └── ...
         └── ...
         ```

      4. Never place block files:
         - In the project root
         - In subdirectories outside react/src/blocks
         - In any other location

examples:
  - input: |
      # Bad: Block files in wrong location
      src/blockName.tsx
      components/blockName-name.scss
      a-sample/card-demo/CardDemo.tsx

      # Good: Component files in correct location
      react/src/blocks/card-demo/card-demo.tsx
      react/src/blocks/card-demo/card-demo.scss
    output: "Correctly placed EDS-built block files"
